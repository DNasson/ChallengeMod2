# Portfolio Challenge 2

The portfolio is a sample of the work that I have completed thus far in the coding bootcamp. It will allow potential employers the opportunity to see my work when considering me for a job. 

Description
The portfolio includes information about me and the work that I have done before beginning bootcamp. I have included contact information and 2 projects from bootcamp and the pre-work for bootcamp. The functionality will allow users to choose which tab they would like to explore and the UI will scroll to that section. My included works are titled and there is an image with each that previews or describes the work. My email, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles are linked at the bottom of the page.
