                    My name is Danielle, I am an aspiring coder that is working in healthcare while I am attending school. My husband and I got married in December last year. We have 2 cats, a dog and a turtle that make life interesting for us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked as a certified nurses assistant in all the available settings since I was in high school. My favorite place has been in the hospital, I am currently working on the Shock Trauma ICU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My husband works QA as a software developer and he introduced me to coding. I am excited to continue learning and build my skills so I can move into a new career path.
